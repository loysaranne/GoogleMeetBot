/* Notes */

// Various XPaths and element class names or ids are not explained throughout this source; there's probably a better way to have a permanent selector to a specific element though

// The Audio part of this package has not yet been implemented

// This code can be improved in many ways, but I wrote this during the beginning of Covid lockdown; I've only now decided to add a license and create a repository to publish

// This package aims to be similar to the Discord JS library
